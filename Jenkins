MASTER AND SLAVE:
when we continously build jobs on jenkins ,it will get load and have the chance to crash.
to avoid this load on jenkins we use salve servers to build the jobs


slaves are our ec2-servers
jenkins slaves are used to build the jobs
master will commnicate with salve using ssh.
here on slave agent should be installed (java-11)
without java-11 our slaves will not work.
slaves are platform independent.
label: way of assigning work to particular slave.
