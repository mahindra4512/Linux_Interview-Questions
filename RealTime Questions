1. How do you check running processes in Linux?
Ans: ps -ef, top, htop(if installed)
"I usually use ps -ef to get a snapshot of all the running processes with full details. For real-time monitoring, I use top, and if htop is available, I prefer that since it gives a more user-friendly view with interactive options."
2. What’s the difference between top, htop, and ps?
Ans:                                                                                  
 ps   :-Shows a static snapshot of current processes (`ps -ef` or `ps aux`)                           
 top :- Real-time dynamic view of processes; updated continuously                                     
 htop :- Enhanced version of `top` with color UI, scrolling, filtering, and process tree (interactive) 
3. How to schedule a cron job every 15 minutes?
Ans:"I edit the crontab using crontab -e and add an entry like */15 * * * * /path/to/script.sh. This means the script will run every 15 minutes. I also redirect the output to log files for monitoring."
4. What is the difference between hard link and soft link?
Ans:A hard link is another name for the same file and points to the same inode, so the file still works even if the original is deleted. A soft link, or symbolic link, is like a shortcut — it points to the file path. If the original file is deleted, the soft link breaks. Also, soft links can work across file systems, but hard links can’t.
5. How to find which process is using high memory?
Ans:ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -n 10
Or run top or htop and sort by memory column.
I usually run ps aux --sort=-%mem | head to sort processes by memory usage. Alternatively, I use top or htop and sort by the memory column to identify the process consuming the most RAM. This helps in investigating memory leaks or spikes."
6. What is sed command in linux , write an example for it ?
