1.branching strategy.
Ans:We primarily used a combination of main, develop, and feature branches:

main branch always contained the stable production-ready code.

develop branch was used for integration and testing of all feature branches.

For each new feature or task, we created a feature/<task-name> branch from develop. After completion and review, it was merged back into develop via a pull request.

Before a release, we created a release/<version> branch from develop for final testing and staging.

In case of urgent production issues, we used hotfix/<issue> branches from main, tested and merged them back into both main and develop.
2.typical branches in dev?
3.How do you resolve merge conflicts?
Ans:"When a merge conflict occurs, Git marks the conflicting sections in the file. 
I open the file, look for the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>), and manually choose which changes to keep or combine. After editing, I mark the file as resolved with git add <file>, then complete the merge with git commit. 
I also run git status frequently to track unresolved files."
4.Difference between git pull, git fetch, and git clone
Ans:git pull:-Fetches changes from remote and merges them into your current branch.
 git fetch:-Only downloads changes from remote – does not merge. Used for review.
git clone:-Downloads the full repository (code + history) to your local system.
5.Use case of git stash.
Ans:git stash is useful when I need to quickly switch branches but don’t want to commit my current changes.
I use it if I’m working on a feature and suddenly need to switch to a hotfix branch without losing progress.
6.What is .gitignore and how does it work
Ans:we can add the files which we dont want to track or commit.
7.What’s the difference between git rebase and git merge?
merge we use public repos, private repos we use rebase
merege will store history, rebase will not store entire history
merge will show files, rebase will not show files

8.How can we remove a file from Git without removing the filesystem?
9. How can we discover if a branch has already been merged in Git?
